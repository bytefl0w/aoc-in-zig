# Advent of Code 2022 in Zig
Oh yes, another Advent of Code done in Zig :) I will probably not finish all of
the AoC days - I am doing this to get practice with the language and get a
better understanding of how it works, compared to languages I've programmed in
the past. I really liked C and miss programming in it, so I am hopeful this will
go well.
